# Lets-Use-Python
For intermediate programmers &amp;&amp; Python beginners.

It helps to know the fundamentals of programming. If you know or started learning C, then that's all the basic knowledge you need to know to get started. That just means I won't stop to explain what data types are, what a header file is, etc.

Much of my comparison to Python will be C or C++. If you know C, but not C++, don't worry too much. Much of the syntax is the same.

If you already know about Python interpreters and the basics, then skip ahead to Lesson 3 or 4 (currently still a working process, come back later and hopefully I'll have those lessons completed).
